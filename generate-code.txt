First I copied the WSDL file location to src/main/resources and all the XSD files it links too.
Then remove the remote http location so that all locations for the wsdl and referenced xsd files are local.
Then run wsimport.

cd ~/development/workspaces/games/awsl-history-client/
wsimport -keep -d src/main/java -wsdllocation https://portal.amisco.eu:9891/wsdl.xml src/main/resources/history.wsdl
